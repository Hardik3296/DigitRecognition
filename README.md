# DigitRecognition
This project involves creating our own Artificial Neural Network and training the network to recognize all the digits from 0-9. For this project I have used Backpropagation algorithm to train the neural netwok.
## Dataset 
The dataset used for this project is the [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) which contains around 60000 images for training the neural network and 10000 images for testing it.
## Description of the dataset
The datset consisits of images of size 28 X 28 stored as a single vector of 1 X 784. There are around 60000 such vectors that constitue the dataset for training the network. Similarly the testing dataset also consists of 10000 28 X 28 images represented as vectors of size 1 X 784.
